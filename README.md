# Analyzing-Amazon-Product-Review.
 A data analysis project focused on Amazon product reviews using Microsoft Excel. This project includes data cleaning, pivot tables, review counts by category, discount percentage analysis, and dashboard creation for insights into product performance 
 ## What I Learned in This Data Analysis Training

Throughout this Data Analysis training program, I have developed strong foundational skills in tools such as Microsoft Excel and Power BI, which I used extensively to carry out this Amazon Product Review Analysis.

### ‚úÖ Excel
I learned how to clean and structure raw data, use formulas like IF, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIFS, and create Pivot Tables to summarize and explore large datasets. I also created calculated columns to support deeper analysis and used charts to visualize insights effectively.

### ‚úÖ Power BI
Power BI has helped me learn how to transform data using Power Query, build interactive dashboards, and use visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and slicers to explore data across multiple fields. It also improved my storytelling and helped me communicate findings clearly.



### üß† SQL (Still Learning)
Although I am still working on fully understanding SQL, I‚Äôve been introduced to its importance in querying databases, filtering data, and extracting insights using SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY statements. I look forward to mastering SQL as I continue practicing.

Overall, this training has given me confidence in using data to uncover trends, solve problems, and support decision-making. This project is my first step toward becoming a professional data analyst.
## Project Topic:E-commerce analytics solution
## Project Overview
As a beginner in data analysis, this project marks the completion of my training in Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and introductory SQL. The purpose of this capstone project is to apply the skills I have learned in a real-world scenario by analyzing Amazon product review data.
I was given a dataset containing various information about products sold on Amazon, including their names, categories, prices, ratings, and customer reviews. My task was to explore the dataset, clean and organize it using Excel, analyze patterns using pivot tables and formulas, and finally present my findings with a dashboard.
This project has helped me gain practical experience in working with raw data, drawing conclusions from patterns, and creating visual insights that support business decisions. It also reflects my understanding of the foundational tools used by data analysts.

## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project was to carry out an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Amazon using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. As someone new to data analysis, this project gave me the opportunity to practice using Pivot Tables, calculated fields, and charts to solve real business problems.

The specific business questions I was expected to answer include:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2.  How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4.  Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs. discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual price √ó rating count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
Completing this project has helped me to understand how data is used to answer real business questions and how Excel can be used as a powerful analysis tool.

Tool Used: Pivot Table
Steps:
Insert Pivot Table
Rows: Category
Values: Average of Discount %
Insight: Categories like "Fashion" and "Electronics" had higher average discounts, indicating they may be more competitive or frequently promoted.

üî∏ Q2. How many products are listed under each category?
Tool Used: Pivot Table
Steps:
Rows: Category
Values: Count of Product Name

In conclusion I'm grateful for this oppurtunity to be part of this training and this project helped me apply what I‚Äôve learned in Excel and Power BI to real data. I now feel more confident analyzing datasets, answering business questions, and presenting insights visually. I look forward to improving my SQL skills and continuing my data analysis journey.
